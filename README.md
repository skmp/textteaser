TextTeaser
==========

# Fork by skmp 
Added a post-midnight style api and sample js (this might be the worst day to do this, first time touching scala code)

to use you need java and sbt, then
1. git clone https://github.com/MojoJolo/textteaser.git
2. sbt run
3. look into tease.js on how to use

This is currently running on one of my servers, but i don't guarantee i'll keep it up

Make sure to check the original [site](http://www.textteaser.com/), its awesome (but slow)

# Original readme follows
